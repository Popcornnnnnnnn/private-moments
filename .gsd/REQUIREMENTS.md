# Requirements

This file is the explicit capability and coverage contract for the project.

## Active

### R001 — Non-trivial work must end with a minimum closure loop: change summary, verification evidence, known issues or next steps, and updates to affected fact-source or human-facing docs.
- Class: operational
- Status: active
- Description: Non-trivial work must end with a minimum closure loop: change summary, verification evidence, known issues or next steps, and updates to affected fact-source or human-facing docs.
- Why it matters: This project spans iOS, server, admin, local storage, and real-device behavior; losing end-of-work context makes future maintenance risky.
- Source: workflow alignment discussion 2026-04-30
- Validation: A completed non-trivial change includes fresh verification output and either updated docs/fact sources or an explicit note that none were affected.

### R002 — High-risk work must use milestone/slice planning before implementation when it can affect sync semantics, schema migrations, media storage or recovery, backup or restore, auth/security boundaries, or cross-device behavior.
- Class: operational
- Status: active
- Description: High-risk work must use milestone/slice planning before implementation when it can affect sync semantics, schema migrations, media storage or recovery, backup or restore, auth/security boundaries, or cross-device behavior.
- Why it matters: These areas can corrupt data, hide records, break recovery, or weaken the private network boundary even when changes are small.
- Source: workflow alignment discussion 2026-04-30
- Validation: High-risk changes have a milestone or slice context/plan before code changes and include success criteria plus verification evidence.

### R003 — Verification depth must be proportional to change impact: server/admin changes require build and HTTP or browser checks; iOS changes require build; sync, media, storage, and real-device behavior require device install or device data inspection when feasible.
- Class: operational
- Status: active
- Description: Verification depth must be proportional to change impact: server/admin changes require build and HTTP or browser checks; iOS changes require build; sync, media, storage, and real-device behavior require device install or device data inspection when feasible.
- Why it matters: A single fixed verification rule is either too weak for data-risk changes or too heavy for low-risk maintenance.
- Source: workflow alignment discussion 2026-04-30
- Validation: Completion summaries name the verification class used and include the command or inspection evidence.
